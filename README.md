# CERberus -- guardian against character errors

This Python script provides an implementation of Character Error Rate (CER) calculation between a reference string and a hypothesis string, with various customization options available for pre-processing the strings and detailed reporting of results. It allows you to set specific options such as ignoring case, punctuation, whitespaces, numbers, newlines and returns, and other specific characters.
